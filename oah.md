Hello neighbors!

 
As part of the work we’re doing representing the best interests of tenants, in January QHTA filed a tenant petition with the DC Rental Accommodations Division and Office of Administrative Hearings (OAH) to hold Quebec House accountable under DC rent control laws for failing to provide the amenities we’re paying for. We're working on reaching a settlement that could provide financial compensation to each unit as well as concessions to improve overall conditions by management. However, **we need signatures from each unit (all lease-signers signing at once) to include you in a potential settlement--or the award from a hearing, if it comes to that.**


If you'd like to sign, please fill out [this web form](https://forms.gle/PmpsvXM5BoxfqXyD7) to authorize QHTA to represent you (if you have two people on your lease, please sign it together). We'll also have QHTA members set up at tables in the North and South lobbies at the times to grab people who aren't on the listserv and answer any questions folks have. More information on this effort and the tenant association can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ym3OQW58O6hMfJxn5pK19FYt9udOFwhJri4M3EJh60c/edit?usp=sharing).


We will be in both lobbies on these dates:
- Tuesday, 7/22, 5:30-7:30pm
- Saturday, 7/26, 10am-12pm
- Sunday, 7/27, 3-5pm
- Wednesday, 7/30, 5:30-7:30pm
- Thursday, 8/7, 5:30-7:30pm
- Monday, 8/11, 6-8pm
  
 
If we don’t receive your signature by July 31, we will be knocking on your door to see if you'd like to sign and have the QHTA represent you in this petition (consent can be revoked later if desired). Our next QHTA meeting is Thursday, July 31, at 7pm in the club room (South 2nd floor), when we'll go quickly through our usual updates and then turn our attention to a basic canvassing training. All tenants are welcome to attend if you are interested in helping out in this big effort! 
 
Thank you for [signing the form](https://forms.gle/PmpsvXM5BoxfqXyD7) and have a great night!
 
Best,
Shannon Hayes
Quebec House Tenant Association President
